Welcome 

### Online Learning Website - Class Project

This project was initiated during my studies.

Project is implemented using Java Spring Boot framework and some additional libraries.
For FrontEnd implementation I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript using thymeleaf.

The main purpose of the application is to enable users to learn something new and developed their skills. 
The system consists of two user roles with specific capabilities:
- ADMIN
- USER



The application can also be accessed by unregistered users, who have the following abilities:
- Register an account
- Access about us section 



Registered users with the *USER* role can log into the system using their username and password. They have the following abilities:
- learn any programming language they want for free



Users with the *ADMIN* role have the following abilities:
- Add new Subject for learning
- Update the Content for a particular subject 
- Delete the particular subject 



Website has fully responsive design for users.

### Website UI preview:
- Users first need to Register and then login to the website



### Application UI preview:
- Users need to select the specific Subject, then they can see Content/Tutorial for that Subject and easily learn.
